#  A Simple Basket Calculator whipped up in 2.5 hours


## Notes

This is not a real app. If it were, I would have at least done the following:
- replace stub data model for items with one that will actually scale, since the current implementation is highly unscalable.
- finish navigation bar, decide which top-level actions should be assigned to the all-important corner buttons.
- fix numeric -> string issues, such as rounding.
- finish laying things out properly.
- extract all configurable bits into info plist (e.g. API key).
- write error handling for network access, json parsing, calculations.
- write tests for the model layer.
- have a long discussion with the designer.
